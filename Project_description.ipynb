    "# Project for Econ 622, Jan Rosa: package HA_solver\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I developed the package to solve two basic (workhorse) macroeconomic models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neoclassical stochastic growth model (representative agent model): I solve it by 2D fixed point problem\n",
    "- Aiyagari model: model with hereogenous agents which face the idiosycratic earnings risks\n",
    "- I planned to add also the model for the soverign default (which I will add anyway by the end of the year, but after deadline), I was not able to finish that model \n",
    "- I have old code for the Hugget model, but I do not test it for this project\n",

    "## General way of solving the models  \n",
    "I divided the macroeconomic models on the two cathegories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heterogenous agent models\n",
    "- Representative agent models\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second cathegory, the general way of solving is very simple: defined by the genral function SolveRAEq. We firstly solve the model: find polcy function for the model. As there are a lot of possible way to solve the model, (value function, projection method- which we use it now), we defined it as a general function SolveRAP. Next, we simulate the model, by general function SolveDistr, last we use the function to save equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Heterogenous agent models, the general procedure is more complicated, defined in the genral (using generic programming) function SolveHAEq. The aim of the algorithm, is to find a fixed/ stationary point (whatever defined) of the  equilirbirum for some variable which defines it (for example an interest rate), which we will then call equilibrium variable. The main steps of the algorithm are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solve individual agent problem: defined by input SolveAgP\n",
    "- Aggregate the equilibrium/ find the distribution of agent: defined by input SolveDistr\n",
    "- Update the equilibrium variable: UpdateGEq\n",
    "- Check the convergence of the equilibrium variable: ConvSolParam\n",

That is we defined 2D grid:$(x_j, y_j)$ where $x_j$ is a log of capital value, $y_j$ is the log of TFP. The gird was transformed the the Smolyak grid (special set of points for fast multidimensional interpolation), and the tensor product of the interpolating Chebyschev polynomials (interpolated on the grid). We compute future possible $y_j'$, and discrete probability of drawing that value by Gauss quadrature: $w_i$. Next, we solve the model in the steps:\n",
